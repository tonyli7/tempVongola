How to use

    1. make
    2. run ./server
    3. open more terminal windows and run ./client on them

       This can work across multiple computers on the same 
       network.

       Need 9 clients to connect for game to start.

       IMPORTANT NOTE:
       
       Chat system is imperfect since users can interrupt 
       another user's typing.

    Client commands:
    
    /p to get a list of all the players:
       
       id name status votes
       
    /v <id> to vote for someone

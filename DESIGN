Description
	
  Objective: 

  A clone of the game Mafia.

  User Interface: 

  Players will initially be prompted to enter a temporary username to join the game. Once the 
  host begins the game, other players who would like to join will have to wait until the game is 
  over. Players are assigned their role randomly and will be directed to a window with a list of 
  all the living players, dead players and their roles, and a chat. After a period of time, the 
  players are then prompted to vote for someone by typing their username to lynch if they wish to. 
  Each player’s decision will be displayed after the voting period is over. The accused will be 
  moved to the dead list and his/her role will be revealed. The night session will take place and 
  the players can perform their night action. The mafia can talk amongst one another and vote to 
  kill one of the non-mafia people. The game ends when a victory condition is reached.

Technical Design: 

  -Players will be linked through networking. We will be implementing a Central Dispatch Server.
  -Semaphores will be used to limit who can join the game.
  -Structs to organize the player’s roles and status
  -Process player input
  -Signals to end the game, or to kill off players

Other features we may implement:
	
  -Lobby system in which users may create games or join already existing games
  -Color coded text for organization
  -ore roles
  -Narrator

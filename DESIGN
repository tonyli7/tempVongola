Description
	
  Objective: 

  A clone of the game, Mafia.

  User Interface: 

  Players will initially be prompted to enter a username to join the game.
  Once there are enough players, the game will start automatically from Day 1.
  On the first day, everyone will have their roles private messaged to them by the server.
  During the day, everyone in the town can chat with each other and try to figure out who is mafia.
  People can vote to lynch people any day other than day 1. Majority is needed to lynch someone.
  	"type in: "-v #" where # is the id of the person you want to vote for.
  	"type in: "-p" to see the player list.
  At night, only mafia can see each other's chat and can vote on who to kill for the night. (Same commands)
  The game will automatically end where there is only members of one group left standing.

Technical Design: 

  -Players will be linked through networking. We will be implementing a Central Dispatch Server with sockets.
  -Structs to organize the playerâ€™s roles and status.
  -Process player input similar to command line.
  -Catching signals whenever a player quits.

Other features we may implement:
	
  -Lobby system in which users may create games or join already existing games
  -Color coded text for organization
  -More roles
  -Narrator
